<h2>About</h2>
Moon Trading is a user friendly	paper-trading platform where users can create a portfolio with real stock data from <a href="finnhub.io">Finnhub.io's</a> public stock APIs. This portfolio will provide the user with several metrics to help educate them on future financial moves.

<h2>Goals and Requirements</h2>

My main goal was to learn the basics of web development while researching a topic that I was interested in. I chose to create a paper-trading website in order to provide users with a free and safe way to practice and experiment with trading. With MoonTrading users are able to buy or sell (using fake currency) stocks and monitor the growth of their portfolios.

<h2>Key Learnings</h2>

- Designing and deploying a website.
- Login & form validation.
- Working with and fetching data from public APIs through user's search input.
- Writing & retrieving data from a local MySQL database.
- The concepts and basic implementation of a relational database.
- Working with 'sessions' in PHP to validate user logins.

<h2>Built With</h2>

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- JQuery
- PHP
- MySQL with XAMPP
